Environment: Using python 3.7 with numpy library

Steps to run code:
1. Set up initial and goal array, initial array and goal array are stored at the top of the project_1.py file as input_arr and goal_arr and can be edited directly in the code
2. Run code in terminal using python3 project_1.py assuming you are in the directory of the script
3. Output .txt files should be created or edited if already existing in the directory

Comments:
Had some confusion regarding the storage of matrices as column by row instead of row by column, but in the sample Nodes.txt they are simply stored as a list

Either way, the output files and search function work the exact same and return the exact same output files no matter how the matrix is interpreted

Only confusing thing might be the naming of the move functions: i.e. Node.move_up moves the blank tile to the left if column by row instead of up
